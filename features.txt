V1
public chat
users list
private chat
basic dumb css
Authentication and Authorization
Deploy

V2
Allow anonymous users and loggedin users, prevent same username with same connectionid
Users get a random image 
Registered users can change their chat name and photo also can create their own group (just add the btn in client)
    -- save in db user profile and connect to the hub with it
Details - like validation, opening chats from user list too
add own emoticons 

f̶r̶i̶e̶n̶d̶l̶i̶s̶t̶ -̶   pointless task
last css, try a decent one

V3
Create own chat by group, give administrator role and be able to give roles or ban people
Custom css for each group - some basic colors to change
notify when new private message
status, disconnected or connected

Bugs after V2
Fixed - Connectionlist not retrieved properly anymore
Fixed - Adding Removing static vs cloud images not working properly

OnDisconnectasync throws exception sometimes, fix after v3
